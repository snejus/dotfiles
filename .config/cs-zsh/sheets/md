# Some guidance, but not absolutely necessary:
#
#   * Keep columns 8 tabs apart.
#   * Provide a space after each section.
#   * Underlines are the width of the word.
#   * Try to keep descriptions within a single line.
#
# The cheatsheet will be displayed exactly as you see it here - as a flat text file.
# Comments are ignored, but only if they occupy the entire line on their own -
#  trailing comments are not ignored.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).
Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
